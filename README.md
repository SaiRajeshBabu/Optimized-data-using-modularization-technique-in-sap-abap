Optimized data using modularization technique in sap-abap


ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming) is the programming language of the SAP system. 
ABAP programming plays an important role in the implementation process of the ERP (enterprise resource planning system).
The pros and cons of ABAP programs will directly affect the application of ERP in business. The internal table in the ABAP program plays an important role. 
Therefore, by researching on the type of internal table, read and join internal tables, the proposed system provides the optimization of efficiency in ABAP application program based on internal table and modularization techniques. 
On joining internal tables and including the modularization techniques of SAP ABAP, 
proposed an improved algorithm of joining internal tables which as a result improves the time complexity of the program, 
the performance of program.
